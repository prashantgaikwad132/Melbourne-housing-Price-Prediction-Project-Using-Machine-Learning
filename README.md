# Melbourne-housing-Price-Project-Using-Machine-Learning
In this project, I built several regression models to predict the price of some houses given some of the house features. I evaluated and compared each model to determine the one with the highest performance. After that, I have started the process of getting the data, then cleaning and preprocessing the data, followed by exploring the data and building models, then evaluating the results and communicating them with visualizations.
